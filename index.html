        <p> The ruling party wants to walk on the path of reform without abolishing the quota system in government jobs.
            Many at the policy-making level of the government and the ruling party Awami League think that it would not
            be right to abolish this system under pressure from the anti-quota movement. However, the interest of all
            will have to be protected by reducing the existing 56 percent quota. Several important leaders of the
            government and Awami League have said this to Kaler Kantho.

        <p>
            Several sources in the government said that the government does not want to take any decision to reform the
            quota system. Since the matter is sub judice in the high court, it will be a convenient option for the
            government to wait for their decision. The government will implement the verdict of the court. As a result,
            there is little possibility of any decision from the government at the moment under the pressure of the
            anti-quota movement.
